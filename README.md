Now,we have made a basic code to run a clendar,about visual operation,we use the include what is named SDL.
we should make a clendar which can search days and show the time,they are all done, during this time,I solved many problems painfully because I just a new person for write the code,and,I am learning the relevant konwledge just now.
the next step we will polish the window that could support to key input the year and month what you want search. I will record the difficulties I have confronted with. the first serious difiiculty is  when i input the data the variate
just could receive one number,but you know, we should it receive a string of numbers,I will try my best to deal with this issue,I have having a simple think already ,which creat a veriate to constantly receive data utill press the "enter".  

we have deal with this issue that input keys in the render,now I want add a background image to window,but I have no idea,so I plan to ask my team to get some suggestions. in addition, I am going to add a function which can add sechedul for user,I think this function is the most difficult function in what i have made ,well,let is go.
